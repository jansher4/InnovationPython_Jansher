<h1>Python Minor Project 1<h1>

This project is simple simulation of an elevator with 10 floors.

All the libraries used are native to Python3 on MacOS Mojave.

Simple run the main.py file via terminal by typing:

		"python3 main.py"
After running; 

The system will speak and provide current floor level of the elevator.

Later, it will ask what floor you are on? After providing the your standing floor level,

the elevator will come to you meanwhile providing the status(floor-level) of the incoming elevator.

Once you are inside the elevator, yo will be greeted with a welcome note. Afterwards, you will be asked your desired/destination floor. After taking you to desired floor.

The system will take the elevator to a random floor-level and repeat the process.
